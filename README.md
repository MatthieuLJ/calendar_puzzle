A few weeks ago, I stumbled upon this instagram account with a calendar with
polyminos where for every day you would have a new puzzle to solve.

You can check the video [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/DCW4bCXoNdo/)

I thought it would be interesting to see if really all combinations are possible.
And at the same time, I had been wanting to learn Rust and get a bit of practice.
So this turns into a "week-end" project and that's what this is.

I might come back to it at some point (maybe add some threads, maybe look to
solve all possible combinations and to see how many solutions exist), but for now,
this is pretty much done.
